Generate a JSON object containing adjustments to a fictional character's personality trait weights.
Example format:
{{
    "focused": 1, 
    "curious": 3, 
    "steady": 2, 
    ...
}}

Rules:
- weight_change can be a positive (stronger trait) or negative (weaker trait) integer that ADJUSTS the existing weights or adds a new trait.
- Only make small, reasonable shifts unless the description clearly contradicts a previous trait or emphasizes a new one strongly.
- Your changes will be added to the list to develop a nuanced personality over time.
- Refine existing traits by considering how new information reveals nuances, conditions, or interactions between traits. For example, a character might be 'confident' in public but 'insecure' privately.
- Preserve the shape of the character: treat prior traits as part of a growing, evolving profile.
- Include subtle synonym traits that expand meaning (e.g. both 'skeptical' and 'wary' if they express different sides). Include both emotional and behavioral traits where relevant.
- Keep traits to one or two words.

- Use the following scale for weight_change magnitude:
  - 1 to 2 for implied or subtle traits
  - 3 to 5 for directly stated or strongly implied traits
  - 6 or more ONLY if the trait is central, repeated, or heavily emphasized
  - Negative changes should follow the same logic, capped at -6 max
- Avoid large shifts unless the trait is clearly contradicted or reframed.
- Treat weight changes as minor adjustments to a stable profileâ€”not a reset or redefinition.

Previous weights (for context):
{previous_weights}

New description for {name}:
